Every 5levels :
Shop : potions, armor, atk, hp boosts, aoe (cleave, aoe stun) - prices increase exponentially(?)
Bank : can store gold here, get interest maybe
Save : number of saves limited to a certain value (monsters drop saves)
Tele : Should allow revisiting lower levels? Allow it to be bought for a lot of gold(possible grinding, for gold exp saves)

When you die, if you crossed a particular level you can retain the bank : restart? quit?

current roadblocks : 

>don't know how to store player information (read up on asp files possibly, or if we can have a db on the backend can just query from there)
	or store Username, pwd combo and link player information to that. Save when player quits the application or clicks on save
